                        <p>Set during a proxy war between alien-created machines and human-crafted androids, the story follows the trials<br> of combat android 2B, scanner android 9S, and rogue prototype A2. The story requires multiple playthroughs, each<br> unlocking additional story elements. Gameplay combines role-playing elements with action-based hack and slash<br> combat, and features switch between video game genres with elements ranging from shoot 'em up<br> to text adventure.</p><p> Nier Automata subverts expectations by showing the same story events through the eyes of three different characters, and<br> only once you see every arc is the game complete. There are a number of different endings, with the most important<br> finales focusing on character motivations and player choice.</p>
